<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/4LkIZOP.png)

## What I learned
-  How tu use media queries, best web design practises (em, mobile-first etc.)
-  I touched BEM methodology (I don't really like it to be honest) for naming css classes and also looked at other methodologies
-  That using Table of content in my css file is a really good idea
-  How to make a footer which is stucked at the bottom of the page, without any problems or bugs
-  [soft skills] That I have to think more and write less. That I should take more breaks when coding (pomodoro technique would be a good idea). Also, being under a little bit presure is a good thing. This will make me more efficient in the next project.
